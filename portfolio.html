		<p id="p-p">This section was based on a brief to design any artist portfolio.
		My portfolio site was based on German, Morrocan artist by the name of Tasnim Baghdadi, based in Switzerland.<br>
		I am a huge fan of her work and am always inspired by her facination for both traditional and modern art. Her work is metaphorical and communicated in a very simplistic style. This played a major role in how I chose to create the layout for this UI. The idea was to keep the design simple, allowing the artworks to breathe. In terms of color, I was inspired by a common thread in her collections, of black and white along with shades of grey and red to add some variation.<br><br>To the left are page examples of the UI I designed and developed.

				<h1>UI Design |<br> Travel Blog</h1>
				<p>This section was based on a brief to design a travel blog, which I then based mine on a couple who travels all over and shares their experiences with the world.<br><br> The idea was to keep the design clean and simplistic, creating an easy user experience. I chose a theme of colors that to me, resembles nature. Colors such as green, orange- and then neutral colors such as black and white to create a balance.<br><br>To the left are page examples of the UI I designed and developed.

				<h1>Website Redesign |<br> Online Store</h1>
				<p>This section was based on a brief to redesign any online store. I chose the brand ALFRED SUNG, which has an existing online store.<br><br>The idea was to keep my layout as close to the existing UI in terms of color, however making the user journey/experience a more convenient one.<br><br>To the left are page examples of the UI which I designed and developed.

				<h1>Wesite design |<br> Promotional Site</h1>
				<p>This section was based on a brief to design any promotional site. I decided to use the new Dolce & Gabbana Men's Fall collection as bases for my promotional site. The idea was to design a simplistic UI, incorporating elements of the collection. I created this two page promotional site using plugins such as Fullpage.js and Lightbox, along with different image animation styling.<br><br>To the left are page examples of the UI I designed and developed.
